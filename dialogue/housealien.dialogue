Ursa: [speed=0.5]Greetings traveller, I see you have come to me in search of a way to the city. Take this glove, it can be used to harvest materials.
Ursa: [speed=0.5]Locate the cave and enter it, then use your newfound tool to harvest 5 pieces of gold and iron, deliver those to me and I will teleport you into the city
